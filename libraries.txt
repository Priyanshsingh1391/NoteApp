When you're building a frontend (React, etc.) and backend (Node.js, Express, etc.) locally on different ports, like:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:8000

...your browser sees these as different origins. So, if your frontend tries to make a request to your backend, the browser blocks it by default unless the server explicitly allows it via CORS.
